# Youtube's Intro Videos

<img src="/intro-image.png" alt="Name in Youtube Intro Videos" />

This small repository contains the new intros for my Youtube videos.

The animations were made by simply using a .txt file containing HTML and CSS code.

As for the background image, it was modified using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
